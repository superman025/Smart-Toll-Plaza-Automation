# API Gateway

The **API Gateway** serves as the unified entry point for the Smart Toll Plaza Automation System.

Instead of allowing clients to communicate directly with individual microservices, all requests are first sent to the API Gateway. It receives each request, determines the appropriate destination, and forwards it to the corresponding microservice, enabling centralized routing and smooth communication.

This architecture reduces client complexity, enhances scalability, and creates a clear separation between frontend applications and backend services.

---

# Responsibilities

* Offer a single access point for all API requests
* Forward requests to the correct microservice
* Conceal internal service endpoints
* Simplify client-to-service communication
* Manage centralized request routing
* Improve application maintainability

The API Gateway is intentionally lightweight and contains only the configurations required for request routing. It does not include controllers, services, repositories, entities, or database components.

---

# Purpose of API Gateway

### Without API Gateway

```text
Client

 ├── Vehicle Service

 ├── Wallet Service

 ├── Journey Service

 └── Toll Service
```

In this model, the client must be aware of the address and port number of every individual microservice.

### With API Gateway

```text
             Client

                │

                ▼

          API Gateway

                │

     ┌──────────┼──────────┐

     ▼          ▼          ▼

 Vehicle     Wallet     Journey

 Service     Service     Service

                │

                ▼

          Toll Service
```

Using an API Gateway, the client communicates through a single endpoint while the gateway transparently routes each request to the appropriate service.

---

# Default Port

```text
8080
```

---

# Route Configuration

| Incoming Request | Routed To       |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `/vehicles/**`   | Vehicle Service |
| `/wallet/**`     | Wallet Service  |
| `/journeys/**`   | Journey Service |
| `/toll/**`       | Toll Service    |

# Example URLs

Instead of calling

```text
http://localhost:8081/api/v1/vehicles
```

Access the service through the API Gateway:

```text
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vehicles
```

---

Instead of

```text
http://localhost:8082/api/v1/wallets
```

Use

```text
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallets
```

<img width="1917" height="597" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447e5c21-28fe-4aff-9080-9cdd3e1bc0b4" />

---

Instead of

```text
http://localhost:8083/api/v1/journeys
```

Use

```text
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/journeys
```

<img width="1917" height="1041" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22bac05e-1c3e-4032-8bf3-df0892bf642e" />

Instead of

```text
http://localhost:8084/api/v1/tolls
```

Use

```text
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tolls
```

<img width="1911" height="815" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46851162-e9e6-493b-a434-48f26c009ae1" />
